        <h3>You can do this by moving and modifying the shape of the grey rectangle on the canvas below.</h3>
        <h3>You can filter higher frequencies by moving the rectangle upwards, and listen to segments further in time by moving the box to the right.</h3>
        <h4>Move the position of the rectangle with the following arrows &#8593;&#8595;&#8592;&#8594; </h3>
